			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>
				The aim of this document is to get you started with developing
				applications for Node.js, teaching you everything you need to
				know about "advanced" JavaScript along the way. It goes way
				beyond your typical "Hello World" tutorial.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document is currently work in progress and about 80%
				finished.
			</p>

			<h3>Intended audience</h3>
			<p>
				This document will probably fit best for readers that have a
				background similar to my own: experienced with at least one
				object-oriented language like Ruby, Python, PHP or Java, only little
				experience with JavaScript, and completely new to Node.js.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aiming at developers that already have experience with other
				programming languages means that this document won't cover
				really basic stuff like data types, variables, control structures
				and the likes. You already need to know about these to understand
				this document.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, because functions and objects in JavaScript are different
				from their counterparts in most other languages, these will be
				explained in more detail.
			</p>

			<h3>Structure of this document</h3>
			<p>
				Upon finishing this document, you will have created a complete web
				application which allows the users of this application to view web
				pages and upload files.
			</p>
			<p>
				Which, of course, is not exactly
				world-changing, but we will go some extra miles and not only create
				the code that is "just enough" to make these use cases possible,
				but create a simple, yet complete framework to cleanly separate the
				different aspects of our application. You will see what I mean in a
				minute.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will start with looking at how JavaScript development in Node.js
				is different from JavaScript development in a browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, we will stay with the good old tradition of writing a "Hello
				World" application, which is a most basic Node.js application that
				"does" something.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, we will discuss what kind of "real" application we want to
				build, dissect the different parts which need to be implemented to
				assemble this application, and start working on each of these parts
				step-by-step.
			</p>
			<p>
				As promised, along the way we will learn about some of the more
				advanced concepts of JavaScript, how to make use of them, and
				look at why it makes sense to use these concepts instead of
				those we know from other programming languages.
			</p>

			<h2>JavaScript and Node.js</h2>

			<h3>JavaScript and You</h3>
			<p>
				Before we talk about all the technical stuff, let's take a
				moment and talk about you and your relationship with
				JavaScript. This chapter is here to allow you to estimate
				if reading this document any further makes sense for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are like me, you started with HTML "development"
				long ago, by writing HTML documents. You came along this
				funny thing called JavaScript, but you only used it in a
				very basic way, adding interactivity to your web pages
				every now and then.
			</p>
			<p>
				What you really wanted was "the real thing", you wanted to
				know how to build complex web sites - you learned a
				programming language like PHP, Ruby, Java, and started
				writing "backend" code.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nevertheless, you kept an eye on JavaScript, you saw that
				with the introduction of jQuery, Prototype and the likes,
				things got more advanced in JavaScript land, and that this
				language really was about more than <em>window.open()</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, this was all still frontend stuff, and although it
				was nice to have jQuery at your disposal whenever you felt
				like spicing up a web page, at the end of the day you were,
				at best, a JavaScript <em>user</em>, but not a JavaScript
				<em>developer</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				And then came Node.js. JavaScript on the server, how cool
				is that?
			</p>
			<p>
				You decided that it's about time to check out the old, new
				JavaScript. But wait, writing Node.js applications is the
				one thing; understanding why they need to be written the
				way they are written means - understanding JavaScript.
				And this time for real.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is the problem: Because JavaScript really lives two,
				maybe even three lives (the funny little DHMTL helper from
				the mid-90's, the more serious frontend stuff like jQuery
				and the likes, and now server-side), it's not that easy to
				find information that helps you to learn JavaScript the
				"right" way, in order to write Node.js applications in a
				fashion that makes you feel you are not just using
				JavaScript, you are actually developing it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because that's the catch: you already are an experienced
				developer, you don't want to learn a new technique by just
				hacking around and mis-using it; you want to be sure that
				you are approaching it from the right angle.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is, of course, excellent documentation out there.
				But documentation alone	sometimes isn't enough. What is
				needed is guidance.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to provide a guide for you.
			</p>

			<h3>A word of warning</h3>
			<p>
				There are some really excellent JavaScript people out
				there. I'm not one of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm really just the guy I talked about in the previous
				paragraph. I know a thing or two about developing backend
				web applications, but I'm still new to "real" JavaScript
				and	still new to Node.js. I learned some of the more
				advanced aspects of	JavaScript just recently.
				I'm not experienced.
			</p>
			<p>
				Which is why this is no "from novice to expert" book. It's
				more like "from novice to advanced novice".
			</p>
			<p>
				If I don't fail, then this will be the kind of
				document I wish I had when starting with Node.js.
			</p>

			<h3>Server-side JavaScript</h3>
			<p>
				The first incarnations of JavaScript lived in browsers.
				But this is just the context. It defines what you can
				do with the language, but it doesn't say much about what
				the language itself can do. JavaScript is a "complete"
				language: you can use it in many contexts and achieve
				everything with it you can achieve with any other
				"complete" language.
			</p>
			<p>
				Node.js really is just another context: it allows you to run
				JavaScript code in the backend, outside a browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to execute the JavaScript you intend to run in the
				backend, it needs to be interpreted and, well, executed.
				This is what Node.js does, by making use of Google's V8 VM, the
				same runtime environment for JavaScript that Google
				Chrome uses.
			</p>
			<p>
				Plus, Node.js ships with a lot of useful modules, so you don't
				have to write everything from scratch, like for example
				something that outputs a string on the console.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, Node.js is really two things: a runtime environment and a
				library.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to make use of these, you need to install Node.js.
				Instead of repeating the process here, I kindly ask you to
				visit
				<a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation"
				   title="Building and Installing Node.js">the official
				installation instructions</a>. Please come back once you
				are up and running.
			</p>

			<h3>"Hello World"</h3>
			<p>
				Ok, let's just jump in the cold water and write our first
				Node.js application: "Hello World".
			</p>
			<p>
				Open your favorite editor and create a file called
				<em>helloworld.js</em>. We want it to write "Hello World"
				to STDOUT, and here is the code needed to do that:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">console.log("Hello World");
</pre>
			<p>
				Save the file, and execute it through Node.js:
			</p>
<pre>node helloworld.js</pre>
			<p>
				This should output <em>Hello World</em> on your terminal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, this stuff is boring, right? Let's write some real
				stuff.
			</p>


			<h2>A full blown web application with Node.js</h2>

			<h3>The use cases</h3>
			<p>
				Let's keep it simple, but realistic:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The user should be able to use our application with
					a web browser
				</li>
				<li>
					The user should see a welcome page when
					requesting http://<em>domain</em>/start
				</li>
				<li>
					When requesting http://<em>domain</em>/upload, the
					user should be able to upload an image file	from
					his computer, which is then displayed in his
					browser
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Fair enough. Now, you could achieve this goal by googling
				and hacking together <em>something</em>. But that's not
				what we want to do here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, we don't want to write only the most basic
				code to achieve the goal, however elegant and correct this code
				might be. We will intentionally add more abstraction than
				necessary in order to get a feeling for building more
				complex Node.js applications.
			</p>

			<h3>The application stack</h3>
			<p>
				Let's dissect our application. Which parts need to be
				implemented in order to fulfill the use cases?
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					We want to serve web pages, therefore we need an
					<strong>HTTP server</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					Our server will need to answer differently to
					requests, depending on which URL the request was
					asking for, thus we need some kind of
					<strong>router</strong> in order to map requests
					to request handlers
				</li>
				<li>
					To fullfill the requests that arrived at the server
					and have been routed using the router, we need
					actual <strong>request handlers</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					The router probably should also treat any incoming
					POST data and give it to the request handlers in
					a convenient form, thus we need <strong>request
					data handling</strong>
				</li>
				<li>
					We not only want to handle requests for URLs, we
					also want to display content when these URLs are
					requested, which means we need some kind of
					<strong>view logic</strong> the request handlers
					can use in order to send content to the user's
					browser
				</li>
				<li>
					Last but not least, the user will be able to upload
					images, so we are going to need some kind of
					<strong>upload handling</strong> which takes care of
					the	details
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Let's think a moment about how we would build this stack
				with PHP. It's not exactly a secret that the typical setup
				would be an Apache HTTP server with mod_php5 installed.
				<br/>
				Which in turn means that the whole "we need to be able to
				serve web pages and receive HTTP requests" stuff doesn't
				happen within PHP itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, with node, things are a bit different. Because with
				Node.js, we not only implement our application, we also
				implement the whole HTTP server. In fact, our web
				application	and its web server are basically the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				This might sound like a lot of work, but we will see in a
				moment that with Node.js, it's not.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's just start at the beginning and implement the first
				part of our stack, the HTTP server.
			</p>

			<h3>Building the application stack</h3>
			<h4>A basic HTTP server</h4>
			<p>
				When I arrived at the point where I wanted to start with my
				first "real" Node.js application, I wondered not only how to
				actually code it, but also how to organize my code.
				<br/>
				Do I need to have everything in one file? Most tutorials on
				the web that teach you how to write a basic HTTP server in
				Node.js have all the logic in one place. What if I want to
				make sure that my code stays readable the more stuff I
				implement?
			</p>
			<p>
				Turns out, it's relatively easy to keep the different
				concerns of your code separated, by putting them in
				modules.
			</p>
			<p>
				This allows you to have a clean main file, which you
				execute with Node.js, and clean modules that can be used by
				the main file and among each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, let's create a main file which we use to start our
				application, and a module file where our HTTP server code
				lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				My impression is that it's more or less a standard to name
				your main file <em>index.js</em>. It makes sense to put	our
				server module into a file named <em>server.js</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's start with the server module. Create the file
				<em>server.js</em> in the root directory of your project,
				and fill it with the following code:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("Hello World");
  response.end();
}).listen(8888);
</pre>
			<p>
				That's it! You just wrote a working HTTP server. Let's
				prove it by running and testing it. First, execute your
				script with Node.js:
			</p>
<pre>node server.js</pre>
			<p>
				Now, open your browser and point it at
				<a href="http://localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/</a>.
				This should display a web page that says "Hello World".
			</p>
			<p>
				That's quite interesting, isn't it. How about talking about
				what's going on here and leaving the question of how to
				organize our project for later? I promise we'll get back to
				it.
			</p>

			<h4>Analyzing our HTTP server</h4>
			<p>
				Well, then, let's analyze what's actually going on here.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first line <em>require</em>s the <em>http</em> module
				that ships with Node.js and makes it accessible through the
				variable <em>http</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We then call one of the functions the http module offers:
				<em>createServer</em>. This function returns an object, and
				this object has a method named <em>listen</em>, and takes
				a numeric value which indicates the port number our HTTP
				server is going to listen on.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please ignore for a second the function definition that
				follows the opening bracket of <em>http.createServer</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We could have written the code that starts our server and
				makes it listen at port 8888 like this:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

var server = http.createServer();
server.listen(8888);</pre>
			<p>
				That would start an HTTP server listening at port 8888
				and doing nothing else (not even answering any incoming
				requests).
			</p>
			<p>
				The really interesting (and, if your background is a more
				conservative language like PHP, odd looking) part is the
				function definition right there where you would expect the
				first parameter of the <em>createServer()</em> call.
			</p>
			<p>
				Turns out, this function definition IS the first (and only)
				parameter we are giving to the <em>createServer()</em>
				call. Because in JavaScript, functions can be passed around
				like any other value.
			</p>

			<h4>Passing functions around</h4>
			<p>
				You can, for example, do something like this:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function say(word) {
  console.log(word);
}

function execute(someFunction, value) {
  someFunction(value);
}

execute(say, "Hello");</pre>
			<p>
				Read this carefully! What we are doing here is, we pass the
				function <em>say</em> as the first parameter to the
				<em>execute</em> function. Not the return value of
				<em>say</em>, but <em>say</em> itself!
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, <em>say</em> becomes the local variable
				<em>someFunction</em> within <em>execute</em>, and execute
				can call the function in this variable by issuing
				<em>someFunction()</em> (adding brackets).
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, because <em>say</em> takes one parameter,
				<em>execute</em> can pass such a parameter when calling
				<em>someFunction</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can, as we just did, pass a function as a parameter to
				another function by its name. But we don't have to take this
				indirection of first defining, then passing it - we can
				define and pass a function as a parameter to another
				function in-place:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function execute(someFunction, value) {
  someFunction(value);
}

execute(function(word){ console.log(word) }, "Hello");
</pre>
			<p>
				We define the function we want to pass to <em>execute</em>
				right there at the place where <em>execute</em> expects its
				first parameter.
			</p>
			<p>
				This way, we don't even need to give the function a name,
				which is why this is called an <em>anonymous function</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a first glimpse at what I like to call "advanced"
				JavaScript, but let's take it step by step. For now, let's
				just accept that in JavaScript, we can pass a function as
				a parameter when calling another function. We can do this
				by assigning our function to a variable, which we then
				pass, or by defining the function to pass in-place.
			</p>

			<h4>How function passing makes our HTTP server work</h4>
			<p>
				With this knowledge, let's get back to our minimalistic
				HTTP server:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

http.createServer(function(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("Hello World");
  response.end();
}).listen(8888);
</pre>
			<p>
				By now it should be clear what we are actually doing here:
				we pass the <em>createServer</em> function an anonymous
				function.
			</p>
			<p>
				We could achieve the same by refactoring our code to:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

function onRequest(request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("Hello World");
  response.end();
}

http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
</pre>
			<p>
				Maybe now is a good moment to ask: Why are we doing it
				that way?
			</p>

			<h4>Event-driven callbacks</h4>
			<p>
				The answer is a) not that easy to give (at least for me), and
				b) lies in the very nature of how Node.js works. It's
				event-driven, which is the reason why it's so fast.
			</p>
			<p>
				You might want to take the time to read Felix
				GeisendÃ¶rfer's excellent post
				<a href="http://debuggable.com/posts/understanding-node-js:4bd98440-45e4-4a9a-8ef7-0f7ecbdd56cb">Understanding node.js</a>
				for some background explanation.
			</p>
			<p>
				It all boils down to the fact that Node.js works event-driven.
				Oh and yes, I, too, don't know exactly what that means.
				But I will try and explain, why this makes sense for us
				who want to write web based applications in Node.js.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we call the <em>http.createServer</em> method, we
				of course not only want to have a server listening at
				some port, we also want to do something when there is an
				HTTP request to this server.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem is, this happens asynchronously: it happens
				at any given time, but we only have a single process in
				which our server runs.
			</p>
			<p>
				When writing PHP applications, we aren't bothered by this
				at all: whenever there is an incoming HTTP request, the
				webserver (usually Apache) forks a new process for just
				this request, and starts the according PHP script from
				scratch, which is then executed from top to bottom.
			</p>
			<p>
				So in regards of control flow, we are in the midst of our
				Node.js program when a new request arrives at port 8888 - how
				to handle this without going insane?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, this is where the event-driven design of
				Node.js/JavaScript actually helps, although we need to learn
				some new concepts in order to master it. Let's see how
				these concepts are applied in our server code.
			</p>
			<p>
				We create the server, and pass a function to the method
				creating it. Whenever our server receives a request, the
				function we passed will be called.
			</p>
			<p>
				We don't know when this is going to happen, but we now have
				a place where we can handle an incoming request. It's our
				passed function, no matter if we first defined it or passed
				it anonymously.
			</p>
			<p>
				This concept is called a <em>callback</em>. We pass into
				some method a function, and the method uses this function
				to <em>call back</em> if an event related to the method
				occurs.
			</p>
			<p>
				At least for me, this took some time to understand. Just
				read Felix' blog post again if you are still unsure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's play around a bit with this new concept. Can we prove
				that our code continues after creating the server, even if
				no HTTP request happened and the callback function we
				passed isn't called? Let's try it:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

function onRequest(request, response) {
  console.log("Request received.");
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("Hello World");
  response.end();
}

http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);

console.log("Server has started.");
</pre>
			<p>
				Note that I use <em>console.log</em> to	output a text whenever
				the <em>onRequest</em> function (our callback) is triggered,
				and	another text right <em>after</em> starting the HTTP server.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we start this (<em>node server.js</em>, as always), it
				will immediately output "Server has started." on the
				command line. Whenever we request our server (by opening
				<a href="http://localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/</a>
				in our browser), the message "Request received." is printed
				on the command line.
			</p>
			<p>
				Event-driven asynchronous server-side JavaScript with
				callbacks in action :-)
			</p>
			<p>
				(Note that our server will probably write "Request received."
				to STDOUT two times upon opening the page in a browser. That's
				because most browser will try to load the favicon by requesting
				http://localhost:8888/favicon.ico whenever you open
				http://localhost:8888/).
			</p>

			<h4>How our server handles requests</h4>
			<p>
				Ok, let's quickly analyze the rest of our server code, that
				is, the body of our callback function <em>onRequest()</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the callback fires and our <em>onRequest()</em> function
				gets triggered, two parameters are passed into it:
				<em>request</em> and <em>response</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those are objects, and you can use their methods to handle
				the	details of the HTTP request that occured and to respond
				to the request (i.e., to actually send something over
				the wire back to the browser that requested your server).
			</p>
			<p>
				And our code does just that: Whenever a request is
				received, it uses the <em>response.writeHead()</em>
				function to send an HTTP status 200 and content-type in the
				HTTP response header, and the <em>response.write()</em>
				function to send the text "Hello World" in the HTTP
				response body.
			</p>
			<p>
				At last, we call <em>response.end()</em> to actually finish
				our response.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point, we don't care for the details of the
				request, which is why we don't use the <em>request</em>
				object at all.
			</p>


			<h4>Finding a place for our server module</h4>
			<p>
				Ok, I promised we will get back to how to organize our
				application. We have the code for a very basic HTTP server in
				the file <em>server.js</em>, and I mentioned that it's common
				to have a main file called <em>index.js</em> which is used
				to bootstrap and start our application by making use of the
				other modules of the application (like the HTTP server module
				that lives in <em>server.js</em>).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's talk about how to make server.js a real Node.js module
				that can be used by our yet-to-be-written <em>index.js</em>
				main file.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you may have noticed, we already used modules in our code,
				like this:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

...

http.createServer(...);
</pre>
			<p>
				Somewhere within Node.js lives a module called "http", and we can
				make use of it in our own code by requiring it and assigning
				the result of the require to a local variable.
			</p>
			<p>
				This makes our local variable an object that carries all the
				public methods the <em>http</em> module provides.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's common practice to choose the name of the module for the
				name of the local variable, but we are free to choose whatever
				we like:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var foo = require("http");

...

foo.createServer(...);
</pre>
			<p>
				Fine, it's clear how to make use of internal Node.js modules. How
				do we create our own modules, and how do we use them?
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's find out by turning our <em>server.js</em> script into a
				real module.
			</p>
			<p>
				Turns out, we don't have to change that much. Making some code
				a module means we need to <em>export</em> those parts of its
				functionality that we want to provide to scripts that require
				our module.
			</p>
			<p>
				For now, the functionality our HTTP server needs to export is
				simple: scripts requiring our server module simply need to
				start the server.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make this possible, we will put our server code into a
				function named <em>start</em>, and we will export this
				function:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");

function start() {
  function onRequest(request, response) {
    console.log("Request received.");
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
    response.write("Hello World");
    response.end();
  }

  http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
  console.log("Server has started.");
}

exports.start = start;
</pre>
			<p>
				This way, we can now create our main file <em>index.js</em>,
				and start our HTTP there, although the code for the server is
				still in our <em>server.js</em> file.
			</p>
			<p>
				Create a file <em>index.js</em> with the following content:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var server = require("./server");

server.start();
</pre>
			<p>
				As you can see, we can use our server module just like any
				internal module: by requiring its file and assigning it to
				a variable, its exported functions become available to us.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's it. We can now start our app via our main script, and it
				still does exactly the same:
			</p>
<pre>node index.js</pre>
			<p>
				Great, we now can put the different parts of our application
				into different files and wire them together by making them
				modules.
			</p>
			<p>
				We still have only the very first part of our application in
				place: we can receive HTTP requests. But we need to do
				something with them - depending on which URL the browser
				requested from our server, we need to react differently.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a very simple application, you could do this directly
				within the callback function <em>onRequest()</em>. But as I said,
				let's add a bit more abstraction in order to make our example
				application a bit more interesting.
			</p>
			<p>
				Making different HTTP requests point at different parts of our
				code is called "routing" - well, then, let's create a module
				called <em>router</em>.
			</p>

			<h4>What's needed to "route" requests?</h4>
			<p>
				We need to be able to feed the requested URL and possible
				additional GET and POST parameters into our router, and based
				on these the router then needs to be able to decide which code
				to execute (this "code to execute" is the third part of our
				application: a collection of request handlers that do the
				actual work when a request is received).
			</p>
			<p>
				So, we need to look into the HTTP requests and extract the
				requested URL as well as the GET/POST parameters from them.
				It could be argued if that should be part of the router or
				part of the server (or even a module of its own), but let's
				just agree on making it part of our HTTP server for now.
			</p>
			<p>
				All the information we need is available through the
				<em>request</em> object which is passed as the first parameter
				to our callback function <em>onRequest()</em>. But to interpret
				this information, we need some additional Node.js modules, namely
				<em>url</em> and <em>querystring</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <em>url</em> module provides methods which allow us to
				extract the different parts of a URL (like e.g. the requested
				path and query string), and <em>querystring</em> can in turn be
				used to parse the query string for request parameters:
			</p>
<pre>                               url.parse(string).query
                                           |
           url.parse(string).pathname      |
                       |                   |
                       |                   |
                     ------ -------------------
http://localhost:8888/start?foo=bar&amp;hello=world
                                ---       -----
                                 |          |
                                 |          |
              querystring(string)["foo"]    |
                                            |
                         querystring(string)["hello"]
</pre>
			<p>
				We can, of course, also use <em>querystring</em> to parse the
				body of a POST request for parameters, as we will see
				later.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's now add to our <em>onRequest()</em> function the logic
				needed to find out which URL path the browser requested:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");
var url = require("url");

function start() {
  function onRequest(request, response) {
	var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
	console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");
	response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
	response.write("Hello World");
	response.end();
  }

  http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
  console.log("Server has started.");
}

exports.start = start;
</pre>
			<p>
				Fine. Our application can now distinguish requests based on the
				URL path requested - this allows us to map requests to our
				request handlers based on the URL path using our (yet to be
				written) router. Thus, we can build our application in a
				RESTful way, because we can now implement an interface that
				follows the guiding principle of <em>Identification of
				resources</em> (see
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#Guiding_principles_of_the_interface">the Representational State Transfer article on Wikipedia</a>
				for background information).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the context of our application, it simply means that we will
				be able to have requests for the <em>/start</em> and
				<em>/upload</em> URLs handled by different parts of our
				code. We will see how everything fits together soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, it's time to actually write our router. Create a new file
				called <em>router.js</em>, with the following content:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function route(pathname) {
  console.log("About to route a request for " + pathname);
}

exports.route = route;
</pre>
			<p>
				Of course, this code basically does nothing, but that's ok for
				now. Let's first see how to wire together this router with our
				server before putting more logic into the router.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our HTTP server needs to know about and make use of our router.
				We could hard-wire this dependency into the server, but because
				we learned the hard way from our experience with other
				programming languages, we are going to loosely couple server
				and router by injecting this dependency (you may want to read
				<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">Martin Fowlers excellent post on Dependency Injection</a>
				for	background information).
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's first extend our server's <em>start()</em> function in
				order to enable us to pass the route function to be used by
				parameter:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");
var url = require("url");

function start(route) {
  function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
    console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");

    route(pathname);

    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
    response.write("Hello World");
    response.end();
  }

  http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
  console.log("Server has started.");
}

exports.start = start;
</pre>
			<p>
				And let's extend our <em>index.js</em> accordingly, that is,
				injecting the route function of our router into the server:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var server = require("./server");
var router = require("./router");

server.start(router.route);

</pre>
			<p>
				Again, we are passing a function, which by now isn't any news
				for us.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we start our application now (<em>node index.js,
				as always</em>), and request an URL, you can now see from the
				application's output that our HTTP server makes use of our
				router and passes it the requested pathname:
			</p>
<pre>bash$ node index.js
Request for /foo received.
About to route a request for /foo
</pre>
			<p>
				(I omitted the rather annoying output for the /favicon.ico
				request).
			</p>

			<h4>Execution in the kingdom of verbs</h4>
			<p>
				May I once again stray away for a while and talk about
				functional programming again?
			</p>
			<p>
				Passing functions is not only a technical consideration.
				With regard to software design, it's almost philosophical.
				Just think about it: in our index file, we could have passed
				the	<em>router</em> object into the server, and the server
				could have called this object's <em>route</em> function.
			</p>
			<p>
				This way, we would have passed a <em>thing</em>, and the server
				would have used this thing to <em>do</em> something. Hey,
				router thing, could you please route this for me?
			</p>
			<p>
				But the server doesn't need the thing. It only needs to get
				something <em>done</em>, and to get something done, you don't
				need things at all, you need <em>actions</em>. You don't need
				<em>nouns</em>, you need <em>verbs</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Understanding the fundamental mind-shift that's at the core of
				this idea is what made me really understand functional
				programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				And I did understand it when reading Steve Yegge's masterpiece
				<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns</a>.
				Go read it now, really. It's one of the best writings related
				to software I ever had the pleasure to encounter.
			</p>

			<h4>Routing to real request handlers</h4>
			<p>
				Back to business. Our HTTP server and our request router are
				now best friends and talk to each other as we intended.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, that's not enough. "Routing" means, we want to
				handle requests to different URLs differently. We would like to
				have the "business logic" for requests to <em>/start</em>
				handled in another function than requests to <em>/upload</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, the routing "ends" in the router, and the router is
				not the place to actually "do" something with the requests,
				because that wouldn't scale well once our application becomes
				more complex.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's call these functions, where requests are routed to,
				<em>request handlers</em>. And let's tackle those next, because
				unless we have these in place there isn't much sense in doing
				anything with the router for now.
			</p>
			<p>
				New application part, new module - no surprise here. Let's
				create a module called requestHandlers, add a placeholder
				function for every request handler, and export these as
				methods of the module:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function start() {
  console.log("Request handler 'start' was called.");
}

function upload() {
  console.log("Request handler 'upload' was called.");
}

exports.start = start;
exports.upload = upload;
</pre>
			<p>
				This allows us to wire the request handlers into the router,
				giving our router something to route to.
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point we need to make a decision: do we hard-code usage
				of the requestHandlers module into the router, or do we want a
				bit more dependency injection? Although dependency injection,
				like every other pattern, shouldn't be used only for the sake
				of using it, in this case it makes sense to loosely couple the
				router and its request handlers, and thus making the router
				really reusable.
			</p>
			<p>
				This means we need to pass the request handlers from our server
				into our router, but this feels even more wrong, which is why
				we should go the whole way and pass them to the server from	our
				main file, and passing it on to the router from there.
			</p>
			<p>
				How are we going to pass them? Right now we have two handlers,
				but in a real application, this number is going to increase and
				vary, and we sure don't want to fiddle around mapping requests
				to handlers in the router anytime a new URL / request handler
				is added. And having some
				<em>if request == x then call handler y</em> in the router
				would be more than ugly.
			</p>
			<p>
				A varying number of items, each mapped to a string (the
				requested URL)? Well, sounds like an associative array would be
				a perfect fit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, this finding is slightly disappointed by the fact that
				JavaScript doesn't provide associative array - or does it?
				Turns out, it's actually objects that we want to use if we need
				an associative array!
			</p>
			<p>
				There's a nice introduction to this at
				<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163419.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163419.aspx</a>,
				let me quote the relevant part:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					In C++ or C#, when weâre talking about objects, we're
					referring to instances of classes or structs. Objects have
					different properties and methods, depending on which
					templates (that is, classes) they are instantiated from.
					That's not the case with JavaScript objects. In JavaScript,
					objects are just collections of name/value pairs - think of a
					JavaScript object as a dictionary with string keys.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				If JavaScript objects are just collections of name/value pairs,
				how can they have methods? Well, the values can be strings,
				numbers etc. - or functions!
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, now finally back to the code. We decided we want to pass
				the list of requestHandlers as an object, and in order to
				achieve loose coupling we want to inject this object into the
				<em>route()</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's start with putting the object together in our main file
				<em>index.js</em>:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var server = require("./server");
var router = require("./router");
var requestHandlers = require("./requestHandlers");

var handle = {}
handle["/"] = requestHandlers.start;
handle["/start"] = requestHandlers.start;
handle["/upload"] = requestHandlers.upload;

server.start(router.route, handle);
</pre>
			<p>
				Although <em>handle</em> is more of a "thing" (a collection of
				request handlers), I propose we name it like a verb, because
				this will result in a fluent expression in our router, as we
				will see soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you can see, it's really simple to map different URLs to the
				same request handler: by adding a key/value pair of
				<em>"/"</em> and <em>requestHandlers.start</em>, we can express
				in a nice and clean way that not only requests to
				<em>/start</em>, but also requests to <em>/</em> shall be
				handled by the <em>start</em> handler.
			</p>
			<p>
				After defining our object, we pass it into the server as an
				additional parameter. Let's change our <em>server.js</em> to
				make use of	it:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");
var url = require("url");

function start(route, handle) {
  function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
    console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");

    route(handle, pathname);

    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
    response.write("Hello World");
    response.end();
  }

  http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
  console.log("Server has started.");
}

exports.start = start;
</pre>
			<p>
				We've added the <em>handle</em> parameter to our
				<em>start()</em> function, and pass the handle object on to
				the <em>route()</em> callback, as its first parameter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's change the <em>route()</em> function accordingly, in our
				<em>router.js</em> file:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function route(handle, pathname) {
  console.log("About to route a request for " + pathname);
  if (typeof handle[pathname] === 'function') {
	  handle[pathname]();
  } else {
	  console.log("No request handler found for " + pathname);
  }
}

exports.route = route;
</pre>
			<p>
				What we do here is, we check if a request handler for the given
				pathname exists, and if it does, we simply call the according
				function. Because we can access our request handler functions
				from our object just as we would access an element of an
				associative array, we have this nice fluent
				<em>handle[pathname]();</em> expression I talked about earlier:
				"Please, <em>handle</em> this <em>pathname</em>".
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, that's all we need to wire server, router, and request
				handlers together! When starting our application and requesting
				<a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>
				in our browser, we can prove that the correct request handler
				was indeed called:
			</p>
<pre>Server has started.
Request for /start received.
About to route a request for /start
Request handler 'start' was called.
</pre>
			<p>
				And opening <a href="http://localhost:8888/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/</a>
				in our browser proves that these requests, too, are indeed handled by
				the <em>start</em> request handler:
			</p>
<pre>Request for / received.
About to route a request for /
Request handler 'start' was called.
</pre>


			<h4>Making the request handlers respond</h4>
			<p>
				Beautiful. Now if only the request handlers could actually send
				something back to the browser, that would be even better,
				right?
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember, the "Hello World" your browser displays upon
				requesting a page still comes from the <em>onRequest</em>
				function in our <em>server.js</em> file.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Handling request" means "answering requests" after all, thus
				we need to enable our request handlers to speak with the
				browser just like our <em>onRequest</em> function does.
			</p>

			<h5>How to not do it</h5>
			<p>
				The straight-forward approach we -  as developers with a
				background in PHP or Ruby - might want to follow is actually
				very deceitful: it works like a charm, seems to make a lot of
				sense, and then suddenly screws things up when we don't expect
				it.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I mean by "straight-forward approach" is this: make the
				request handlers <em>return()</em> the content they want to
				display to the user, and send this response data in the
				<em>onRequest</em> function back to the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's just do this, and then see why it's not such an overly
				good idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				We start with the request handlers and make them return what we
				would like to display in the browser. We need to change
				<em>requestHandlers.js</em> to this:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function start() {
  console.log("Request handler 'start' was called.");
  return "Hello Start";
}

function upload() {
  console.log("Request handler 'upload' was called.");
  return "Hello Upload";
}

exports.start = start;
exports.upload = upload;
</pre>
			<p>
				Good. Likewise, the router needs to return to the server what
				the request handlers return to him. We therefore need to edit
				<em>router.js</em> like this:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function route(handle, pathname) {
  console.log("About to route a request for " + pathname);
  if (typeof handle[pathname] === 'function') {
    return handle[pathname]();
  } else {
    console.log("No request handler found for " + pathname);
    return "404 Not found";
  }
}

exports.route = route;
</pre>
			<p>
				As you can see, we also return some text if the request could
				not be routed.
			</p>
			<p>
				And last but not least, we need to refactor our server to make
				it respond to the browser with the content the request handlers
				returned via the router, transforming <em>server.js</em> into:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");
var url = require("url");

function start(route, handle) {
  function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
    console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");

    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
	var content = route(handle, pathname)
	response.write(content);
    response.end();
  }

  http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
  console.log("Server has started.");
}

exports.start = start;
</pre>
			<p>
				If we start our rewritten application, everything works like
				a charm: requesting <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>
				results in "Hello Start" being displayed in the browser,
				requesting <a href="http://localhost:8888/upload" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/upload</a>
				gives us "Hello Upload", and <a href="http://localhost:8888/foo" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/foo</a>
				produces "404 Not found".
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, then why is that a problem? The short answer: because we
				will run into problems if one the request handlers wants to make
				use of a non-blocking operation in the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's take a bit more time for the long answer.
			</p>

			<h5>Blocking and non-blocking</h5>
			<p>
				As said, the problems will arise when we include non-blocking
				operations in the request handlers. But let's talk about
				blocking operations first, then about non-blocking operations.
			</p>
			<p>
				And instead of trying to explain what "blocking" and
				"non-blocking" means, let's demonstrate ourselves what happens
				if we add a	blocking operation to our request handlers.
			</p>
			<p>
				To do this, we will modify our <em>start</em> request handler
				to make it wait 10 seconds before returning its "Hello Start"
				string. Because there is no such thing as <em>sleep()</em> in
				JavaScript, we will use a clever hack for that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please modify <em>requestHandlers.js</em> as follows:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function start() {
  console.log("Request handler 'start' was called.");

  function sleep(milliSeconds) {
    var startTime = new Date().getTime(); // get the current time
    while (new Date().getTime() &lt; startTime + milliSeconds); // hog cpu
  }

  sleep(10000);
  return "Hello Start";
}

function upload() {
  console.log("Request handler 'upload' was called.");
  return "Hello Upload";
}

exports.start = start;
exports.upload = upload;
</pre>
			<p>
				Just to make clear what that does: when the function
				<em>start()</em> is called, Node.js waits 10 seconds and only then
				returns "Hello Start". When calling <em>upload()</em>, it
				returns immediately, just like before.
			</p>
			<p>
				(Of course, you should imagine that instead of sleeping for
				10 seconds, there would be a real life blocking operation in
				<em>start()</em>, like some sort of long-running computation.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's see what this change does.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, we need to restart our server. This time, I ask you
				to follow a slightly complex "protocol" in order to see what
				happens: First, open two browser windows or tabs. In the first
				browser window, please enter <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>
				into the address bar, but do not yet open this url!
			</p>
			<p>
				In the second browser window's address bar, enter <a href="http://localhost:8888/upload" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/upload</a>,
				and again, please do not yet hit enter.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, do as follows: hit enter on the first window ("/start"),
				then quickly change to the second window ("/upload") and hit
				enter, too.
			</p>
			<p>
				What you will notice is this: The /start URL takes 10 seconds
				to load, as we would expect. But the /upload URL <em>also</em>
				takes 10 seconds to load, although there is no <em>sleep()</em>
				in the according request handler!
			</p>
			<p>
				Why? Because <em>start()</em> contains a blocking operation.
				Like in "it's blocking everything else from working".
			</p>
			<p>
				And that is a problem, because, as the saying goes: <em>"In
				node, everything runs in parallel, except your code"</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				What that means is that Node.js can handle a lot of concurrent
				stuff, but doesn't do this by splitting everything into
				threads - in fact, Node.js is single-threaded. Instead, it does
				so by running an event loop, and we the developers can make use
				of this - we should avoid blocking operations whenever
				possible, and use non-blocking operations instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				But to do so, we need to make use of callbacks by passing
				functions around to other functions that might do something
				that takes some time (like, e.g. sleep for 10 seconds, or query
				a database, or do some expensive calculation).
			</p>
			<p>
				This way we are saying <em>"Hey, probablyExpensiveFunction(),
				please do your stuff, but I, the single Node.js thread, am not
				going to wait right here until you are finished, I will
				continue to execute the lines of code below you, so would you
				please take this callbackFunction() here and call it when
				you are finished doing your expensive stuff? Thanks!"</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				(If you would like to read about that in more detail, please have
				a look at Mixu's post on <a href="http://blog.mixu.net/2011/02/01/understanding-the-node-js-event-loop/">Understanding the node.js event loop</a>.)
			</p>
			<p>
				And we will now see why the way we constructed the "request
				handler response handling" in our application doesn't allow us
				to make proper use of non-blocking operations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once again, let's try to experience the problem first-hand by
				modifying our application.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are going to use our <em>start</em> request handler for this
				again. Please modify it to reflect the following (file
				<em>requestHandlers.js</em>):
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var exec = require("child_process").exec;

function start() {
  console.log("Request handler 'start' was called.");
  var content = "empty";

  exec("ls -lah", function (error, stdout, stderr) {
    content = stdout;
  });

  return content;
}

function upload() {
  console.log("Request handler 'upload' was called.");
  return "Hello Upload";
}

exports.start = start;
exports.upload = upload;
</pre>
			<p>
				As you can see, we just introduced a new Node.js module,
				<em>child_process</em>. We did so because it allows us to make
				use of a very simple yet useful non-blocking operation:
				<em>exec()</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				What <em>exec()</em> does is, it executes a shell command from
				within Node.js. In this example, we are going to use it to get
				a list of all files in the current directory ("ls -lah"),
				allowing us to display this list in the browser of a user
				requesting the <em>/start</em> URL.
			</p>
			<p>
				What the code does is straightforward: create a new variable
				<em>content</em> (with an initial value of "empty"), execute
				"ls -lah", fill the	variable with the result, and return it.
			</p>
			<p>
				As always, we will start our application, and visit
				<a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Which loads a beautiful web page that displays the string
				"empty". What's going wrong here?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, as you may have already guessed, <em>exec()</em> does its
				magic in a non-blocking fashion. That's a good thing, because
				this way we can execute very expensive shell operations (like,
				e.g., copying huge files around or similar stuff) without
				forcing our application into a full stop as the blocking
				<em>sleep</em> operation did.
			</p>
			<p>
				(If you would like to prove this, replace "ls -lah" with a
				more expensive operation like "find /").
			</p>
			<p>
				But we aren't exactly happy with our elegant non-blocking
				operation, when our browser doesn't display its result, right?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, then, let's fix it. And while we are at it, let's try to
				understand why the current architecture doesn't work.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem is that <em>exec()</em>, in order to work
				non-blocking, makes use of a callback function.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our example, it's an anonymous function which is passed as
				the second parameter to the <em>exec()</em> function call:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function (error, stdout, stderr) {
  content = stdout;
}
</pre>
			<p>
				And herein lies the root of our problem: our own code is
				executed synchronous, which means that immediately after
				calling <em>exec()</em>, Node.js continues to execute
				<em>return content;</em>. At this point, <em>content</em> is
				still "empty", due to the fact that the callback function
				passed to <em>exec()</em> has not yet been called - because
				<em>exec()</em> operates asynchronous.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, "ls -lah" is a very inexpensive and fast operation (unless
				there are millions of files in the directory). Which is why the
				callback is called relatively expeditious - but it nevertheless
				happens asynchronously.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thinking about a more expensive command	makes this more
				obvious: "find /" takes about 1 minute on my
				machine, but if I replace "ls -lah" with "find /" in the
				request handler, I still immediately receive an HTTP response
				when opening the /start URL - it's clear that <em>exec()</em>
				does something in the background, while Node.js itself
				continues with the application, and we may assume that the
				callback function we passed into <em>exec()</em> will be called
				only when the "find /" command has finished running.
			</p>
			<p>
				But how can we achieve our goal, i.e. showing the user a list
				of files in the current directory?
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, after learning how to <em>not</em> do it, let's discuss
				how to make our request handlers respond to browser requests
				the right way.
			</p>

			<h5>Responding request handlers with non-blocking operations</h5>
			<p>
				I've just used the phrase "the right way". Dangerous stuff.
				Quite often, there is no single "right way".
			</p>
			<p>
				But one possible solution for this is, as often with Node.js,
				to pass functions around. Let's examine this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now, our application is able to transport the content
				(which the request handlers would like to display to the user)
				from the request handlers to the HTTP server by returning it
				up through the layers of the application (request handler -&gt;
				router -&gt; server).
			</p>
			<p>
				Our new approach is as follows: instead of bringing the content
				to the server, we will bring the server to the content. To be
				more precise, we will inject the <em>response</em> object (from
				our server's callback function <em>onRequest()</em>) through
				the router into the request handlers. The handlers will then be
				able to use this object's functions to respond to requests
				themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enough explanation, here is the step by step recipe on how to
				change our application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's start with our <em>server.js</em>:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var http = require("http");
var url = require("url");

function start(route, handle) {
  function onRequest(request, response) {
    var pathname = url.parse(request.url).pathname;
    console.log("Request for " + pathname + " received.");

    route(handle, pathname, response);
  }

  http.createServer(onRequest).listen(8888);
  console.log("Server has started.");
}

exports.start = start;
</pre>
			<p>
				Instead of expecting a return value from the <em>route()</em>
				function, we pass it a third parameter, our <em>response</em>
				object. Furthermore, we removed any <em>response</em> method
				calls from the <em>onRequest()</em> handler, because we now
				expect <em>route</em> to take care of that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next comes <em>router.js</em>:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">function route(handle, pathname, response) {
  console.log("About to route a request for " + pathname);
  if (typeof handle[pathname] === 'function') {
    handle[pathname](response);
  } else {
    console.log("No request handler found for " + pathname);
    response.writeHead(404, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
    response.write("404 Not found");
    response.end();
  }
}

exports.route = route;
</pre>
			<p>
				Same pattern: instead of expecting a return value from our
				request handlers, we pass the <em>respond</em> object on.
			</p>
			<p>
				If no request handler can be used, we now take care of
				responding with a proper "404" header and body ourselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				And last but not least, we modify <em>requestHandlers.js</em>:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var exec = require("child_process").exec;

function start(response) {
  console.log("Request handler 'start' was called.");

  exec("ls -lah", function (error, stdout, stderr) {
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
    response.write(stdout);
    response.end();
  });
}

function upload(response) {
  console.log("Request handler 'upload' was called.");
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("Hello Upload");
  response.end();
}

exports.start = start;
exports.upload = upload;
</pre>
			<p>
				Our handler functions need to accept the response parameter,
				and have to make use of them in order to respond to the
				request directly.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <em>start</em> handler will respond from within the
				anonymous <em>exec()</em> callback, and the <em>upload</em>
				handler still simply replies with "Hello Upload", but now
				by making use of the <em>response</em> object.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we start our application again (<em>node index.js</em>),
				this should work as expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you would like to prove that an expensive operation behind
				<em>/start</em> will no longer block requests for
				<em>/upload</em> from answering immediately, then modify your
				<em>requestHandlers.js</em> as follows:
			</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var exec = require("child_process").exec;

function start(response) {
  console.log("Request handler 'start' was called.");

  exec("find /",
    { timeout: 10000, maxBuffer: 20000*1024 },
    function (error, stdout, stderr) {
      response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
      response.write(stdout);
      response.end();
    });
}

function upload(response) {
  console.log("Request handler 'upload' was called.");
  response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "text/html"});
  response.write("Hello Upload");
  response.end();
}

exports.start = start;
exports.upload = upload;
</pre>
			<p>
				This will make HTTP requests to <a href="http://localhost:8888/start" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/start</a>
				take at least 10 seconds, but requests to <a href="http://localhost:8888/upload" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:8888/upload</a>
				will be answered immediately, even if /start is still
				computing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Enough for today. Upcoming next: Handling file uploads.
